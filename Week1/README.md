# Week 1 Directory and Branch Created

--Disclaimer--
Updates will be added to this README prior to pushing it to GitHub. Therefore only the final version of this README will be added to the repository

Goals For this Week:
    Research to be done on most effective ways to read in the dummy data. Also must find a way to get the dummy data into the Repository ( hopefully into main branch for easy access ). More research will be accomplished on how to read in data and then write it to a dictionary. Goal is to be able to bring in the dummy data provided by our Industry Mentor and then parse through this and store it in a python dictionary in order to analyze and perform operations on it.

# UPDATE 1:
    SpaceXData.txt File created and added into the main branch along with updated README.md
        This Data will most likely be copied into each Week's Directory for easy use

    Data within the file was also created into a CSV -- making it easier to read in using the csv library provided with python3

# UPDATE 2:
    File_In.py program created -- successfully read in SpaceXData.txt file, followed by the option to either cut or keep the first line with column titles, this is then followed by reading through each row and removing the percent symbol that follows the final element and then prints the newly seperated data to ensure it is done correctly
